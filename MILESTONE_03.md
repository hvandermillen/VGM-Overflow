Made progress with tailwind.css: spent time getting background images to work, blur properly,and fill up the whole screen without covering the header.

Also started working with Google APIs. I had to create a project on the developer console and
set credentials to obtain an apiKey. This is for publicly available information (I will use it to get the title of a video based on the URL), but I also plan to use OAuth2 Client IDs. These will allow users to sign in with their google account and create YouTube playlists from the site.
